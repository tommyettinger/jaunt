/**
 * Indicates that an element has strict timing constraints and has a deterministic time behavior.
 *  
 * The {@link #limit limit} parameter shows the evolution of the [Worst Case Execution Time] of a method with 
 * the cumulative size of the instance and the method inputs (only the size of the inputs for static methods).    
 *     
 * ```java
 * public class FastCollection<E> {
 *     ​@Realtime(limit = LINEAR)
 *     public boolean contains(Object obj) { ... }
 *     
 *     ​@Realtime(limit = N_SQUARE)
 *     public boolean containsAll(Collection<?> that) { ... }
 *     
 *     ​@Realtime(limit = LINEAR, comment = "Could count the elements (e.g. filtered view).")
 *     public abstract int size();
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * The {@link #concurrency} parameter documents the temporal behavior in case of concurrent access, the default is 
 * {@code NOT_THREAD_SAFE} which means that external synchronization or coordination is required. 
 *     
 * ```java
 * public class MyCache<K,V> { 
 *      final Map<K,V> map = new FastMap<K,V>().atomic();
 *      
 *      ​@Realtime(concurrency = LOCK_FREE)
 *      public V get(K key) {
 *          return map.get(key); // Reads over atomic maps are lock-free.
 *      }
 *      
 *      ​@Realtime(concurrency = SYNCHRONIZED)
 *      public V put(K key, V value) {
 *          return map.put(key, value); // Writes over atomic maps are synchronized.
 *      }
 * }
 * ```
 *          
 * If a class is annotated {@link Realtime}, all its methods and constructors are assumed the same temporal behavior 
 * unless explicitly stated. Although Java methods annotations are not inherited, overridden methods 
 * are expected to have to same or more strenuous timing behavior as their parents (otherwise timing assumptions 
 * could be broken by an implementation).
